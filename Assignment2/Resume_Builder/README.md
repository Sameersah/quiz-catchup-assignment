# AI Pair Programmer

Hey there! 👋 This is my cool AI Pair Programmer project. It's like having a coding buddy, but it's a computer! 🤖💻

## What it does

This program helps you write code by giving suggestions and completing parts of your code. It's pretty neat!

Here's what it can do:
- Finish your code lines
- Suggest function names
- Help with debugging
- Explain code snippets

## How to use it

1. Clone this repo to your computer
2. Install the stuff you need (check out `requirements.txt`)
3. Run `python main.py`
4. Start coding and watch the magic happen!

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Some AI libraries (check `requirements.txt` for the full list)

## How it works

It uses a fancy AI model trained on tons of code. When you start typing, it looks at what you've written and tries to guess what you want to do next.

## Known issues

- Sometimes it suggests weird variable names 😅
- Might get confused with really complex code

## Future plans

I want to make it even cooler by:
- Adding support for more programming languages
- Making it understand comments better
- Maybe adding a GUI?

## Credits

Big thanks to:
- My coding teacher for the idea
- The creators of the AI model I used
- Stack Overflow (couldn't have done it without you! 😂)

## License

This project is under the "Do Whatever You Want" license. Just kidding, it's MIT licensed.
