# Auto AI Airline Passenger Satisfaction Predictor

This project uses Auto AI to predict airline passenger satisfaction based on a dataset from Kaggle. The model was trained and deployed using Akkio, achieving a high accuracy rate.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Airline Passenger Satisfaction from Kaggle
- **AI Platform**: Akkio
- **Model Accuracy**: 93% on test set (20% of data)
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed and tested

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset from Kaggle. It contains various features related to airline passengers and their satisfaction levels.

## Model Training and Testing

- The dataset was uploaded to Akkio for automatic AI model creation.
- 80% of the data was used for training the model.
- The remaining 20% was used for testing, resulting in a 93% accuracy rate.

## Deployment

The model has been successfully deployed and is available for testing:

## Data Exploration

Using AI, we explored the dataset by asking questions such as:
- Average customer satisfaction
- Relationship between customer age and satisfaction

## Demo

2. Input the required passenger information.
3. Get the predicted satisfaction level for the passenger.

## Future Work

- Incorporate more recent data to improve model relevance.
- Explore feature importance to understand key factors affecting passenger satisfaction.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the model.
