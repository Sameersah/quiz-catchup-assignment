## Theory

AutoGluon-Tabular leverages several key concepts toachieve robust and accurate predictions:

**1. Ensemble Methods:** AutoGluon combines multiplemodels into an ensemble to improve overall predictiveperformance. This is based on the idea that diversemodels can compensate for each other's weaknesses.Common ensemble techniques include bagging, boosting,and stacking.

**2. Hyperparameter Optimization:** AutoGluonautomatically tunes the hyperparameters of each modelusing techniques like random search or Bayesianoptimization. This helps to find the best settingsfor each model to maximize its performance.

**3. Feature Engineering:** AutoGluon automaticallygenerates new features from the input data to enhancemodel accuracy. This can include transformations likeone-hot encoding, scaling, and creating interactionsbetween features.

**4. Model Selection:** AutoGluon automaticallyselects the best-performing model or ensemble basedon the evaluation metric specified. This ensures thatthe most accurate model is used for prediction.
