**What is association rule mining?**

Association rule mining is a technique used to discover interesting relationships or patterns between variables in large datasets. It is often used in market basket analysis to understand customer purchasing behavior.

**This notebook covers:**

* Generating synthetic transaction data using the Faker library.
* Performing association rule mining using PyCaret's `arules` module.
* Identifying frequent itemsets and generating association rules.
* Visualizing association rules using scatter plots.
* Filtering out specific items from the analysis.

**How to use this notebook:**

1. Run all the code cells in the notebook sequentially.
2. The notebook includes explanations and visualizations of the results.
3. You can modify the code to experiment with different parameters and datasets.


This notebook provides a basic introduction to association rule mining with PyCaret. You can explore the PyCaret documentation and other resources to learn more about this technique and its applications.
