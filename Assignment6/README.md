Portfolio is the project made via github copilot extension which is not a part of the scope current scope of the assignment (It was removed from scode after this was made so keeping in current assignment itself). It has its own readme file.

# **Stroke Prediction Project: A CRISP-DM Based Approach**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to predict stroke risk based on personal and medical data from the **Heart Stroke Dataset** (sourced from Kaggle). The project leverages machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost** to develop an accurate predictive model.

The objective is to:
- Understand the significant factors influencing stroke risk.
- Build and evaluate different machine learning models for stroke prediction.
- Deploy the best-performing model for practical healthcare use.

## **Project Structure**

1. **Business Understanding**: Define the problem and set objectives for predicting stroke risk.
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore and analyze the dataset, focusing on variable distributions and potential issues (e.g., missing values).
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by imputing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data.
4. **Modeling**: Train several machine learning models to predict stroke risk, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best model.
6. **Deployment**: Finalize the deployment-ready model and outline steps for real-world implementation.

## **Chat Transcript**

Here is the **transcript** of my conversation with an AI assistant (from Perplexity.ai), where I performed a step-by-step prediction process on the stroke dataset:
